# Facial_Recognition_System
Engineered a precise Facial Recognition System using deep learning techniques.


**Project Description **

I developed a Facial Recognition System as a personal project for my class, showcasing my skills in image processing and deep learning. The goal of the project was to accurately identify and classify individuals in my class based on facial features. Below is an overview of the key components and achievements of the project: 

Data Collection and Preprocessing 

Collected a dataset containing facial images of each class member. 

Utilized the Python libraries, including PIL and NumPy, to load, resize, and preprocess the images. 

Normalized the image data to enhance model training. 

Autoencoder for Feature Extraction 

Implemented a neural network-based autoencoder to extract essential features from the facial images. 

Trained the autoencoder model for 50 epochs, optimizing for mean squared error using the Adadelta optimizer. 

Visualized the reconstructed images and encoded representations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the autoencoder. 

Classification Model 

Created a classification model based on the encoder part of the autoencoder for accurate label prediction. 

Designed a fully-connected neural network with hidden layers and softmax activation for multi-class classification. 

Achieved high accuracy in predicting class labels using the encoded features. 

Model Evaluation and Visualization 

Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring robust model evaluation. 

Plotted the training and validation loss to showcase the learning progress during model training. 

Visualized the original and reconstructed images along with their predicted labels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the facial recognition system.
